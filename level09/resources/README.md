## Level09

Login as usual wih a password

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub level09@127.0.0.1 -p 4242

```

We can see token file and level09 file.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la

Execute ltrace with level09 file.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ltrace ./level09
__libc_start_main(0x80487ce, 1, 0xbffff7b4, 0x8048aa0, 0x8048b10 <unfinished ...>
ptrace(0, 0, 1, 0, 0xb7e2fe38)                                                 = -1
puts("You should not reverse this"You should not reverse this
)                                            = 28
+++ exited (status 1) +++
```

Can't read the token. I exectued the token with level09 file and we got "tpmhr", hmm. let's dig in to it more.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ cat token
f4kmm6p|=ï¿½pï¿½nï¿½ï¿½DBï¿½Du{ï¿½ï¿½
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 token
tpmhr
```

I put different value after the ./level09 and seems like there's a pattern.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 1
1
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 12
13
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 123
135
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 1234
1357
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 12345
13579
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 a
a
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 ab
ac
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 abc
ace
```

When I executed the string character, I got the result as below.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 abcd
aceg
```

```
input: abcd

a - index 0, ascii + 0, output a
b - index 1, ascii + 1, output c
c - index 2, ascii + 2, output e
d - index 3, ascii + 3, output g


output: acegi
```

Same logic for the number

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 1234
1357
```

```
1 - index 0, ascii + 0, output 1
2 - index 1, ascii + 1, output 3
3 - index 2, ascii + 2, output 5
4 - index 3, ascii + 3, output 7
```

I also, put the value that we've got from the token and it printed the non-printable charachters.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 "f4kmm6p|=pï¿½nï¿½ï¿½DBï¿½Duï¿½ï¿½"

f5mpq;vï¿½Eyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½{ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½XWï¿½ï¿½]ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½
```

So, if we resume this situation:

1. The first value after executable value is incremented based on the ascii chart.

2. And there's also non printbale value to be printed in non readable way for humans.

ðŸ‘‰ So, all we have to do is to create the code to decode it. I will use the C decode
